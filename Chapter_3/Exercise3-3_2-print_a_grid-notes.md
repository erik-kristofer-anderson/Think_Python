I created this program as a solution to an exercise in the book [Think Python 2e](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). The skills exercised were defining functions, calling functions, and defining functions that take a function as an input. There was also some spatial reasoning.

The program prints a four by four grid pattern.

Comments in the [script](https://github.com/erik-kristofer-anderson/Think_Python-Exercises_and_Examples/blob/master/Chapter_3/Exercise3-3_2-print_a_grid.py) should be sufficient to explain how it works.

Yes, this would have been easier with loops, but the exercise spefically said to limit yourself to the techniques covered up to chapter 3.
